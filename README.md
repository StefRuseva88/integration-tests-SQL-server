### This is a test project for **Back-End Test Technologies** January 2024 Course @ SoftUni.
---
## Project Description
This repository contains a test project designed for integration testing with SQL Server. 

## Introduction - LibroConsoleAPI
LibroConsoleAPI is a console-based application built using the .NET Core Framework that manages a collection of books. It allows users to perform CRUD operations in SQL Server database.

## Key Features
This application showcases fundamental software development practices, including integration testing, database management, and console-based application design.
- **Create**: Add new books to the database.
- **Read**: Retrieve details of books from the database.
- **Update**: Modify existing book information.
- **Delete**: Remove books from the database.

## Project Structure
- **LibroConsoleAPI**: This is the primary project for the application, likely serving as the entry point for the API.
- **Business**: This layer is responsible for implementing the functionalities that the application is expected to provide.
- **Common**: Centralized place to define the rules and constraints related to data validation.
- **Data**: This layer of the application consists of models representing the data that the application will manage.
- **DataAccess**: The Data Access layer in the application serves as the bridge between the application's business logic and its data source.
- **Program.cs**: This is where the application starts execution. 
  
## Technologies Used
- .NET Core: The primary framework used for building the console application.
- SQL Server: The database management system used for storing book data.
- Entity Framework Core: An ORM (Object-Relational Mapper) for database interactions.
- xUnit: A unit-testing framework for .NET applications
- nUnit: A unit-testing framework for .NET applications
  
## Docker Integration
You can also run the SQL Server using a Docker image, which simplifies the setup and ensures consistency across different environments. To set up SQL Server with Docker, follow these steps:

1. **Pull the SQL Server Docker image**:

    ```bash
    docker pull mcr.microsoft.com/mssql/server
    ```

2. **Run the Docker container**:

    ```bash
    docker run -e 'ACCEPT_EULA=Y' -e 'SA_PASSWORD=Your_password123' -p 1433:1433 --name sqlserver -d mcr.microsoft.com/mssql/server
    ```

3. **Connect to the SQL Server**:

    - Use the connection string: `Server=localhost,1433;Database=YourDatabase;User Id=sa;Password=Your_password123;`
    - Replace `YourDatabase` with the name of your database.

For more information on using Docker with SQL Server, you can refer to the [official Docker documentation](https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-mssql-server) and the [SQL Server on Docker guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/linux/sql-server-linux-docker-container-deployment).
